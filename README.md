## How I built it
- The oldest but finest web technologies, HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, is used in the construction of our Website. Using HTML5, we first constructed the basic framework of our website, specifying the design, text, and other components required for every page. Then designed the page using CSS3 and using a powerful CSS framework "**BOOTSTRAP** v5". And then goes the animations, which are aided by just simple CSS and JavaScript. Therefore, by using them, I developed a visually appealing, engaging, and user-friendly proposal website that captivates and excites people from the time they enter by utilizing the powers of HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.

## What's next for "But... I Love You ‚ù£Ô∏è"
- I am thinking of converting this website into App and adding some more features like to remind special occasions and dateing system, surprising them with some virtual gifts, and making special fleeting for more impressive moves. This will also help to enhance my learning while doing all these and adding all these features. But for now, I'm just trying to make it compatible to all the devices, so that it will reach to more and more people, and gain some popularity, so that people start contributing in it.
